$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

●	Pull the changes in your git repo to your local machine git directory named “gitlocal” and check the status for the modifications done in that repo. This time demo should be visible in your local machine.
https://github.com/rohan9388/gitlocal


•	Now make a new branch in your local machine with the name “developer”.

Rohan@DESKTOP-3S5F23O MINGW64 ~/Documents/git/gitlocal (master)
$ git checkout -b developer
Switched to a new branch 'developer'





•	Edit that demo file and write some content in that eg: “This is a demo file after modification” and push the modifications to your GitHub repo from the developer branch with a commit message “Commit from developer branch”.
Rohan@DESKTOP-3S5F23O MINGW64 ~/Documents/git/gitlocal (developer)
$ vi demo.txt

Rohan@DESKTOP-3S5F23O MINGW64 ~/Documents/git/gitlocal (developer)

●	Go to the GitHub console and generate a merge request to master branch after checking the modifications.

•	After merging you could see the modified content in the demo file. Now revert back to the previous version from terminal.
After switching back to the previous version your demo file should have the content: This is a demo file before modification.
